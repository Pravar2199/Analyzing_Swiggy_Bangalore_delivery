## Project Overview
The code is divided into two main parts:

######  Data preprocessing: 
This section includes loading the dataset, cleaning and transforming the data, and extracting relevant information for analysis. This is done using pandas, numpy, and other libraries.

###### Data analysis and visualization: 
This section involves using various data analysis techniques and libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to analyze and visualize the data. The analysis includes insights such as popular cuisines, delivery time trends, and top restaurant chains, among others.
Installation
To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

**1. pandas**

**2. matplotlib**

**3. seaborn**

You can install these libraries by running the following command:

> pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Usage

To run the code, simply open the notebook in Jupyter or any other compatible environment and run each cell sequentially. The cells are already arranged in the order of execution.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [ineuron internship](https://internship.ineuron.ai/) and is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FwL6jfwfL5Na_6Pacbv5rjrz9zu5h_i-/view). It contains information about food delivery orders from Swiggy in Bangalore, India.
